<!-- Behavior

Loop over your array of cars and build up an HTML string to build a card for each car. Also, use Bootstrap to create rows. Each row should contain 3 columns. Make sure you have a parent element with a class of container.
Make sure you display all properties of the car in the DOM. Basic styling is up to you.
Put a border around the car information that matches the color of the car. To make this easier, set the color property value to an existing named CSS color.
When you click on one of the car elements, change the width of the border to a higher value, and change the background color to any other color of your choosing.
Also, on click of the car element, clear the value of the text input in the navbar, and put the cursor in the text input.
When you start typing into the navbar's text input, the description of the currently selected car should be bound to what you are typing in and match it exactly.
